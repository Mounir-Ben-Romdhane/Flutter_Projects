here is a brief description of each of my projects:

1-News App using API and BLoC Provider: This app could display the latest news from various sources by consuming data from a news API. The app could use BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture to manage the state of the app, allowing for efficient handling of data updates and network calls. The user interface could be designed to display news articles in a list or grid format with thumbnail images, headlines, and brief descriptions. Tapping on an article could open a detailed view of the article with the full article content, related articles, and a share button.

2-ToDo App using SQFLite and BLoC Provider: This app could help users keep track of their daily tasks and to-do lists. The app could use SQFLite, a lightweight SQL database, to store the list of tasks locally on the device. The app could use BLoC architecture to manage the state of the app, allowing for efficient handling of data updates. The user interface could be designed to display the list of tasks, and the user could add, and delete tasks. The app could allow users to mark tasks as complete, sort tasks by priority or due date, and filter tasks based on completion status.

3-BMI App using BLoC Provider: This app could calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for the user based on their weight and height. The app could use BLoC architecture to manage the state of the app, allowing for efficient handling of data updates. The user interface could be designed to allow the user to enter their weight and height and calculate their BMI. The app could display the BMI value along with a color-coded interpretation of the user's BMI level, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The app could also include a history feature to track the user's BMI over time.
